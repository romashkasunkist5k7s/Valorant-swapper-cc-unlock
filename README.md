## 🧠 Overview

**VALORANT Skin Swapper** is a **conceptual and educational project** created to explore how a weapon skin customization system could be designed from a UI/UX and architectural perspective.

This repository represents a **visual simulation / prototype** that demonstrates:
- skin selection logic,
- preview systems,
- interface structure,
- and animation flow.

The project **does not interact with live game sessions**, does not modify game memory or files, and does not bypass any protection systems.

> ⚠ This project is strictly for **educational, research, and showcase purposes only**.
